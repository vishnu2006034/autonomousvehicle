#  Autonomous vehicles Robot Art Simulation

A simplified, interactive Python simulation using autonomous robots that create generative art while navigating a 2D environment. Inspired by swarm intelligence and robotics algorithms, this project is suitable for learning or demonstration purposes in college-level robotics, AI, or generative art.

## üñºÔ∏è Features

- **Multiple Movement Algorithms**:
  - `random_walk`: Robots explore randomly.
  - `flocking`: Boids-like swarm behavior.
  - `path_planning`: Simple target-seeking behavior.
  - `swarm`: Cooperative, center-attracted group dynamics.
- **Interactive Visualization** with Pygame
- **Real-time Metric Evaluation**:
  - Path Efficiency
  - Art Generation (canvas coverage)
  - Collision Avoidance
- **Environment Types**:
  - Art Gallery
  - Studio
  - Museum
  - Outdoors
- **Art Exporting**: Save artwork data from all robots.
